# To do for Developer Exercise

- create a function that adds elements to the #recommendations div from the json, via a loop
- move away from json in file to making a call to download the json, and run a webserver locally to test
- add css styling to elements
- test with different devices
- internationalisation: currencies and locales

# Done

- bootstrap skeleton so that I get responsive layout for free
- add div with identifier that I'm going to put stuff into: #recommendations
- javascript: take a section of the json file for testing, add it directly to script
